# First Normal Form (1NF)

## Definition
First Normal Form (1NF) requires that:
1. All tables have a primary key
2. All columns contain atomic values (no repeating groups or arrays)
3. All columns contain values of the same domain
4. The order of data does not matter

## Analysis of Current Schema

### Primary Keys
All tables in the schema have a primary key:
- `Category`: `CategoryID`
- `Brand`: `BrandID`
- `AppUser`: `UserID`
- `Product`: `ProductID`
- `CustomerOrder`: `OrderID`
- `OrderItem`: `OrderItemID`
- `Payment`: `PaymentID`

### Atomic Values
All columns contain atomic values:
- No arrays or repeating groups are present
- Each column stores a single value
- Complex data is properly decomposed into separate columns (e.g., address is split into multiple columns)

### Domain Consistency
All columns maintain consistent data types and domains:
- Text fields use appropriate VARCHAR lengths
- Numeric fields use appropriate DECIMAL or INTEGER types
- Timestamps use TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
- Boolean values are represented using appropriate constraints

### Data Order Independence
The schema is order-independent:
- All relationships are maintained through foreign keys
- No implicit ordering is required for data integrity
- Primary keys ensure unique identification regardless of order

## Conclusion
The current database schema fully satisfies First Normal Form requirements. Each table has a proper primary key, all columns contain atomic values, data types are consistent, and the schema is order-independent.
